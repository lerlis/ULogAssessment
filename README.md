This is a repo for health assessment of ULog data to calculate lossfactor and Degree of Contorllability.

The lossfactor is calculated through Kalman filter, and related code or results could also be seen at
[https://rfly-openha.github.io/documents/2_tutorial/examples/tutorial.html](https://rfly-openha.github.io/documents/2_tutorial/examples/tutorial.html)
or
[https://rfly-openha.github.io/documents/4_resources/model_based_KF.html](https://rfly-openha.github.io/documents/4_resources/model_based_KF.html)

Run the lossfactor_doc.m could get the results.
